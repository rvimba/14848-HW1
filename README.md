The five png images in this repository represent the completion of the four manditory github labs and the one extra credit lab.

course-1-complete.png = introduction to github

course-2-complete.png = uploading your project to github

course-3-complete.png = reviewing pull requests

course-4-complete.png = managing merge conflicts

course-5-complete.png = securing your workflows

Each image contains text in the bottom section describing what I learned in the specific couse. Please refer to this text to connect each image with each course. The text should prove that I completed all the required courses and clear up any confusion between courses that use the same "congratulations" image.
