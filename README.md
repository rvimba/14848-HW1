The five png images in this repository represent the completion of the four manditory github labs and the one extra credit lab.

course-1-full-photo.png = introduction to github
course-2-full-photo.png = uploading your project to github
course-3-complete.png   = reviewing pull requests
course-4-full-photo.png = managing merge conflicts
course-5-full-photo.png = securing your workflows

Some of the photos are wide because I wanted to show the name of the repository next to the "congratulations" message, so you may have to scroll right on some photos to see the "congratulations" image.
